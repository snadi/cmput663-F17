Paper Critique Instructions<br/>
Dr. Sarah Nadi -- University of Alberta
</p>

Every class, each student who is not presenting during a paper presentation class will submit a critique for the paper being discussed. If two papers are discussed in a single class, you will have to submit a critique for only one paper. In that case, the instructor will assign you which paper to critique. 

Please submit your critique by 9am on the day the paper will be discussed. You will submit your critique through [EasyChair](http://easychair.org/). Additional instructions on how to use EasyChair will be provided.

Please structure your critique as follows:

* A maximum of 6 sentences summarizing the paper.
* Three bullet points that state the strengths of the paper. For each bullet point, you can add a maximum of 3 sentences elaborating your point.
* Three bullet points that state technical weaknesses of the paper. For each bullet point, you can add a maximum of 3 sentences to elaborate your point. 

Think about strengths/weaknesses in motivation, assumptions, methodology, or evaluation techniques.

Additional advise for critiquing papers can be found [here](http://cs.queensu.ca/~ahmed/home/teaching/CISC880/F16/papers/reviewing-smith.pdf).
