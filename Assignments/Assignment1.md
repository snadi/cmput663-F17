##Goal

The goal of this assignment is to give you hands-on training into some of the MSR techniques used. To make the task easier, you will do a replication study, which is often harder than it seems. 

##The Details

In groups of 2, you will replicate one of the MSR challenge reports from [MSR '12](http://2012.msrconf.org/challenge.php) (Android Data), [MSR '13](http://2013.msrconf.org/challenge.php) (StackOverflow Data), [MSR '14](http://2014.msrconf.org/challenge.php) (GitHub Data), or [MSR '16](http://2017.msrconf.org/#/challenge) (Travis CI Data). 
Challenge reports are short 4-page papers that mined a provided data set. Choose one of the published challenge papers and try to replicate their result. For each conference edition, you will find the challenge reports in the program tab under the Challenge session. 

##Deliverables

* **Public Repository:** Create a public GitHub repository that contains all the **scripts/code** you used to replicate the study, as well as your **results**. Your results should be in the form of some graph or table that is easy to understand. Your repository's **ReadMe** page should explain what is in the repo, how to replicate your results, and any differences from the original study. Differences may include workarounds you had to do to make things work, or simply that your replication did not yield the same results published in the original paper.
* **Presentation:** You will give a 10min presentation on the results of your assignment. Your presentation should:
	* State the challenge paper being replicated
	* What is the problem being solved?
	* Describe the data set and methodology used
	* Describe the results you obtained
	* How did your results compare to the originally published results?
	* Describe any difficulties you faced or lessons you learned in the process
	* Include your GitHub repository URL on your title slide

##Due Date

**Your presentation slides must be uploaded by Tuesday October 3, 2017 at 9am.** Your presentation slides should include the URL of your GitHub repo.

##Grading

The assignment will be graded according to the following criteria:

* My ability to follow your replication instructions and produce your results. If your instructions are not clear, or I cannot re-produce your results, you will loose marks.
* I should be able to see commits from all members of the team. **Your repository should not contain a single commit of uploading everything on the day before the deadline!**
* The clarity of your presentation.

##Advise

* You have a choice between 4 different data sets. Choose a data set that seems exciting/interesting for you. Perhaps you can capitilize on this data set (or at least the techniques you used) later in your project?
* Choose a paper that either clearly describes its methodology in the publication or has public links for its analysis scripts and results. Ideally, both!
* You will quickly realize that there are always some missing details or steps that make it hard to replicate the results. Try your best to figure these out from the paper, the data set instructions, or the authors' online resources. If you absolutely cannot figure it out, make an educated decision about how to proceed and report your assumptions. Of course, you can also always contact the authors to clarify things! However, please do your homework first and make sure this is really a problem.
